# ‚ò£Ô∏è VISCERAL RECLAIMER üíÄ

**>>TRANSMISSION INCOMING... PRIORITY OMEGA...<<**

A festering node of sci-fi base-building & survival against the gibbering apocalypse. Expect blood, biomass, and broken code. Inspired by the corporate dread of Cruelty Squad and the bleak survival of the Zone.

--- // SYSTEM SCAN INITIATED // ---

## > Description_

You are **UNIT: RECLAIMER**. Your directive: carve an outpost from this irradiated corpse-world. Defend the **Nexus Core** - the flickering heartbeat of your operation - against waves of biomechanical horrors ü§ñ and mutated flesh-things üëæ spat out by the wastes. Scavenge **Scrap** üõ†Ô∏è and pulsating **Biomass** ü¶†. Manage your unstable **Survivor** roster - expendable assets prone to injury, insanity, and... *unforeseen biological restructuring* üíâ. Feed the machine. Grow the flesh. Defend the core. Fail, and become just another smear on the landscape.

## > Features_

*   **BASE BLEEDING:** Construct and upgrade facilities on a contaminated grid. Turrets <0xF0><0x9F><0xAA><0xB2>, Hydroponics Pods üå±, Scav Posts üì°... hope they hold.
*   **WAVE SURVIVAL:** Face escalating assaults targeting your Core üíî. Defenses hunger for resources.
*   **RESOURCE ROT:** Juggle Scrap (structural integrity?) and Biomass (life-fuel, mutation substrate, machine-appeasement). Tech üíæ is a rare, corrupted miracle.
*   **SURVIVOR SYNDROME:**
    *   Units acquired: GRONK, FLEC, ZYLIA... more broken vessels await.
    *   Monitor status: `IDLE`, `RAIDING`, `INJURED`, `MUTATED`, `PAUSED [ENCOUNTER]`, `DEAD`.
    *   Apply Biomass Salve (`HEAL`) ü©π. Risk efficiency decrease.
    *   Induce Biomass Overload (`MUTATE`) ‚ò£Ô∏è. Embrace unpredictable alteration. Performance not guaranteed.
*   **BIOMASS BURDEN:**
    *   Key structures demand constant Biomass flow (Upkeep) or cease function üîå.
    *   Fuel for biological processes (Heal, Mutate) and core stabilization (Repair).
*   **RAID REALITY:**
    *   Dispatch `IDLE` units into hazardous Zones: Irradiated Wastes ‚ò¢Ô∏è, Ruined Hospital üè•, Collapsed Bunker üè¢.
    *   Zones dictate duration, potential yield (Scrap/Biomass/Tech +/-), and **Encounter** probability.
    *   Real-time progression. Risk of **[REDACTED - ENCOUNTER PROTOCOL ACTIVE]**. Requires Reclaimer intervention (placeholder).
    *   Return yields: Loot? Injury? Mutation? Asset Loss? The Zone decides.
*   **PATHETIC FINDING:** Hostile entities exhibit rudimentary targeting logic towards the Core. Obstacles impede... usually.
*   **VISUAL MALFUNCTION:** Rendering via PixiJS. Expect CRT vomit, scanlines, and digital decay <0xF0><0x9F><0xAA><0xB2>.
*   **AUDIO DISTURBANCE:** Howler.js generating system alerts, weapon discharge, wet squelches, and background static üîä.

## > Gameplay_Loop_

1.  **ERECT:** Expend resources. Build defenses. Build generation. Hope is inefficient.
2.  **ENDURE:** Hostiles detected. Turrets consume Biomass. Defend the Core. Failure is termination.
3.  **EXTRACT:** Collect residual Scrap/Biomass from terminated hostiles. Minimal gains.
4.  **EXPEND:** Apply Biomass: Heal damaged units? Repair Core systems? Force Mutations? Power Structures? Choose your poison.
5.  **EXPLORE (RAID):** Send `IDLE` units into Zones. Retrieve assets or receive damage reports. High risk. Questionable reward.
6.  **ENHANCE/PREPARE:** Utilize returns. Fortify. Upgrade. The next wave is always worse.
7.  **E[RR]OR:** System crash? Core breach? Inevitable decay? Loop until failure.

## > How_To_Run_

1.  **REQUIREMENT:** Local Web Server (e.g., `python -m http.server`, `node http-server`, VSCode Live Server).
2.  **ACQUIRE:** Clone/Download repository (`index.html`, `main.js`, `game-data.json`).
3.  **NAVIGATE:** Access game directory via terminal.
4.  **EXECUTE SERVER:** e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`
5.  **INTERFACE:** Access via browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). Prepare for system instability.

## > Current_Focus_

*   **[REDACTED] ENCOUNTER SYSTEM:** Implementing interactive choice/consequence during raids.
*   **BIOMASS ECONOMY:** Tuning generation/consumption rates. Evaluating mutation efficacy.
*   **CONTENT INJECTION:** Integrating directives listed in `TODO.md`.
